# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
This project is to implement a machine learning model to find the credit card customers that are likely to churn. A <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> dataset has been used for this project. 

Logistic Regression and Random Forest are used to train the model. There two main files in the project. churn_library.py file includes functionalities like importing the data, performing exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, training and finally plotting the results. churn_script_logging_and_testing.py file includes the unit_tests for different functions in churn_library.py file. The test functions are used to check if the functions in the churn_library.py are returning expected results and not empty.


## Running Files

Both the files can be run individually using 

'''
python churn_library.py
python churn_script_logging_and_testing.py
